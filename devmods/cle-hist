136 ### cle-hist
137 Rich history by default starts with using CLE and doesn't contain items
138 from `.bash_history` file. This module is able to import old records.
139 However the only information that may be contained in old history file is
140 timestamp. No return code and other information may be restored. Imported
141 records will be marked with session ID like 'username-OLD' and working
142 directory will be shown as '/un/known' and they all will appear at the
143 beginning of rich file. Use command `cle hist import`
144  Note: upon very first start of CLE on the account, the `.bash_history` is
145  copied into personal file `.history-username` so all regular seraching
146  methods like 'Ctrl-R' will work.
147 Planned features of this modules are: removing selected entries, archiving
148 and restoring.
